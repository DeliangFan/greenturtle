Green turtle is type of sea turtle which swims slowly but live up to 80 years old.

It's was at the new year of 2024 that in Komodo I enjoyed the turtle dancing across the coras under the water during the SCUBA activity. And my kid told me that unlike turtle, the sea turtle is not able to draw it head back into the shell, which shocked me.

At the new year of 2025 when we enjoying the holidays at Maldives, we all like the green toy turtle in the room of the resort. I know it's time to set up a clear goal about quantitative investment with starting a project for personal quantitive trading, and we name it with greenturtle. And it's also used to hornor the turtle trading.

Like the green turtle, I would prefer swiming slow, but live for a longer time.
